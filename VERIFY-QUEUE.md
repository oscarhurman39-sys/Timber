# Verify queue

Open questions about card FACTS that need Oscar (or a source) to settle. Nothing
here is guessed or auto-corrected — the tools that found these deliberately stop
at "this looks wrong" rather than inventing a value.

Generated and re-checked by `node tools/plant-sense.js`. When you settle one,
fix the card and the line disappears from the tool's output on the next run;
delete it here too.

## How these were found

`tools/plant-sense.js` is a second, independent pass over every card. It cannot
check a fact against the world — it has no sources and no network. What it does
is check every card against **itself**, so a card whose prose says one thing and
whose ratings say another gets surfaced. That turns "are all 128 cards right?"
into a short list a human can actually work through.

Run it after every batch:

```sh
node tools/plant-sense.js            # report
node tools/plant-sense.js --strict   # exit 1 on contradictions (used by tests/run-all.js)
```

## Needs a horticultural call (Oscar)

### 1. Five held climbers have no H × W split — size rails render blank
`Clematis 'Nelly Moser'`, `Clematis 'Purpurea Plena Elegans'`,
`Clematis montana var. rubens`, `Evergreen Clematis` (*C. armandii*),
`Russian Vine` (*Fallopia baldschuanica*).

Their `size` fields read `"2-3m"`, `"8-12m"` etc. Every other card uses
`"<height> H × <spread> W"`, which is what the two side rails read. As written,
both rails are blank on these cards.

**Not auto-fixed on purpose:** the height is there but the spread is not, and
inventing a spread would be making up data. These are all on hold pending photos
anyway, so the fix can ride along with the photo work — but the spread figure has
to come from you or a label, not from the tool.

### 2. Two "compact" plants sit in the 2.5–4 m size band
- **Meyer's Lemon** (*Citrus × meyeri 'Meyer'*) — `2.5–4 m H × 1.5–2.5 m W`, and the
  card is sold on `containers · conservatory`. A container Meyer in the UK is
  usually kept well under that.
- **Kinme Japanese Holly** (*Ilex crenata 'Kinme'*) — `2.5–4 m H × 2.5–4 m W`, with
  `visual` describing "compact texture" and `uses` listing topiary. 'Kinme' is a
  small-leaved compact cultivar; the species can make a big shrub, the cultivar
  generally does not.

Both may be one band step too high. **Unverified** — no source available from
this container to check against RHS. Worth a look at your labels.

### 3. Two margin bands sit below their own gross arithmetic
- **Mexican Orange Blossom** — trade £3.90–£4.60, retail £11.99–£14.99, stated
  margin 55–60%. Even the worst pairing of those prices gives 61.6%.
- **Variegated Dwarf Weigela** — same shape, worst case 61.8% against a stated
  55–60%.

This is only wrong if the margin column is meant to be **gross**. If the band is
net of carriage, potting and shrink, both are fine and the tool should be told to
stop asking. Decide once and it applies to the whole deck.

### 4. Choisya has no ratings at all — SETTLED 2026-08-09, one figure still open
Filled from Oscar's research JSON: `growthSpeed` 9, `thirst` 6, `careLevel` 4,
`sunNeed` 75, `sunMin` 40, and `aspect` is now the real facing
**East / South / West** so the compass and light bar both render. `KNOWN_GAPS` in
`tests/deck-audit.js` is empty for the first time.

**Still needs Oscar: `pestRisk`.** The JSON said **8**; the card carries **3**.
They cannot both be right, and the repo argues for 3:

- `PLANT-BRIEF.md`'s rating scale uses *Choisya itself* as the canonical example
  of the `0–3` "bulletproof" band. Accepting 8 makes the brief's own anchor
  contradict the card it is anchored on.
- The card's `resilience` has read "Pest-free, drought tolerant once established"
  since it was written, and 8 means "occasional aphid/mildew".

3 is the top of the bulletproof band, so it concedes the occasional problem
without breaking the anchor. If Oscar's source for 8 is a real UK observation
(Choisya *does* get scale and honey fungus in some gardens), then the fix is not
just this card — `PLANT-BRIEF.md` needs a different anchor plant for the band.

Two more calls made against the same JSON, both deliberate, neither needing action
unless Oscar disagrees:
- **`hue` stays 150**, not the JSON's 0. The JSON claims 0 is "the Timber
  convention for predominantly white flowers"; the protocol says the opposite —
  changelog v12.4 records 150 as the *Choisya white-flower precedent* and built
  Flower Tower Dogwood on it. The deck is genuinely inconsistent here (Buddleja
  'White Profusion', Davidia and Scabiosa 'Flutter Pure White' all use 0), so
  **"what hue is a white flower" is worth settling once for the whole deck**
  rather than per card.
- **`peak` moved Apr–May → May-Jun** per the JSON. This shifts which month the
  card appears under the "In season now" filter, so it is visible behaviour, not
  just text.

### 5. Japanese Knotweed — the card is legally loaded and the photo is AI art
Added 2026-08-09. Two things need Oscar rather than a tool.

**The compliance text has no field to live in.** The schema has no `compliance`
key, so the legal position rides in `resilience` ("⚠ ILLEGAL TO SPREAD"), `type`
("⚠ NEVER STOCK") and the full paragraph in `returnRisk` — the same borrow
Gunnera uses (protocol v12.21). That is now **four cards** faking the same missing
field (Gunnera's ban, Olive's Xylella, Eryngium's PBR, this). It works, but a
staff member reading only the front card sees "ILLEGAL TO SPREAD · 1cm rhizome
regrows" in the soil warning and nothing else. For a plant where getting it wrong
is a legal problem for the garden centre, that is thin. The parked
compliance-ribbon design is the fix.

**The photo is an AI composite, not a field photo.** Deliberate — Oscar's call
that a never-stock invasive should read as dangerous on sight, and it does. But
the leaf shape and zig-zag habit are the only ID-true parts: the **red-flecked
hollow cane** that the card's own `visual` names, and that actually confirms
knotweed in a customer's garden, is not visible in the shot. As a teaching image
for the one plant on the deck where a mis-ID has legal consequences, a plain
cane-and-leaf photo would do more work. Worth having both — the dramatic one to
make it memorable, a real one on the info sheet to make it identifiable.

`photos/CREDITS.json` records it as Oscar's, `commercialUseCleared: false`,
as `oscar-ai` — **Oscar generated it with ChatGPT and Gemini** (confirmed
2026-08-09). `commercialUseCleared` is false, not because anything is wrong with
it but because output rights for AI images follow the generators' terms and nobody
has checked what OpenAI's and Google's say. That is a ten-minute question for
someone, not a defect.

### 6. Hydrangea serrata — the card says blue, the photo is white
Added 2026-08-09. `hue` is **220 (blue)**, the species archetype from the research
JSON, and the JSON is explicit that colour "ranges from blue and violet through
pink and red according to cultivar and soil chemistry". **Oscar's photo shows a
white-flowered form** with pink-red fertile centres. So the card teaches "blue"
next to a picture of white flowers.

There is a **nursery label visible in the shot**. If it names the cultivar, this
should probably become a cultivar card (like the deck's five other hydrangeas,
all of which are named forms) rather than a species card — which would settle the
hue, the flower colour and the hardiness in one go, since modern serrata cultivars
are often hardier than the species' H4.

Not guessed at either way: changing the hue to match one specimen of a genuinely
variable species is the same class of move as inferring photo provenance from a
tool that was never run.

### 7. Two Hamamelis × intermedia cards disagree on light and water
Same hybrid, two cultivars, two different answers:

| | sunNeed | thirst |
|---|---|---|
| 'Arnold Promise' | 65 | 9 |
| 'Jelena' (new) | 80 | 11 |

Cultivars of one hybrid should not differ this much in light preference — one of
the two is miscalibrated, and the deck now shows them side by side in any search
for "witch hazel". 'Jelena' carries the figures from Oscar's research JSON;
'Arnold Promise' predates it. Worth picking one pair of numbers for both.

## Accepted, not defects

Recorded so the same questions don't get re-litigated every batch.

- **`seasonalImpact` is blank on all 133 cards.** The column exists and validates,
  but nothing has been rated yet and the card renders no row for it. That's an
  empty column, not 133 defects.
- **Dual-season plants flagged by `peak-vs-prose`.** Kousa Dogwood 'Flower Tower'
  and Choshu-hizakura Flowering Cherry both describe autumn colour while their
  bloom band is spring. Both are correct: the card has one bloom band and these
  plants have two seasons of interest. The tool reports these as warnings, not
  contradictions, for exactly this reason.
- **Repeated size strings across many cards.** e.g. twelve cards share
  `"1–1.5 m H × 1–1.5 m W"`. These are banded estimates from a coarse ladder, not
  copy-paste errors. Coarse, but deliberate.

## Photo provenance — CLOSED 2026-08-09

This was listed as 146 photos with no licence record, on the assumption they had
been fetched from Wikimedia. **Wrong: Oscar took every photograph himself.** The
downloader has never been run, `plant-images/` was never committed because nothing
was ever downloaded, and the photo register in `CARD-PROTOCOL.md` never records an
external source for any of them. All 150 photographs are now recorded as his own
and cleared for commercial use.

The only residue is the two AI-generated images (knotweed, Ajuga), covered in
item 5 above. See the README's *Photo provenance* section for the full reasoning,
including why EXIF can't corroborate it (the photos are re-encoded on the way in,
which strips metadata).
